# Navigation Migration

The main goal to this project is to show the migration from an Android project with Jetpack Navigation to a project with Compose Navigation.

There will be 3 branches:

| Syntax                                                               | Description                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Views](https://github.com/DanP1925/NavigationMigration/tree/views)  | The base project to migrate using views and jetpack navigation                                              |
| Compose with ViewNav                                                 | The project with the fragments migrated from views to composable Screens but still using jetpack navigation |
| [Compose](https://github.com/DanP1925/NavigationMigration/tree/main) | The final version with composable Screens and Compose navigation                                            |
